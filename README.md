# Protocols for Decentralized Exchange
These are protocols for exchanging a wide variety of cryptographic assets on a blockchain. All of these protocols implement their feature set via smart contracts.

| Protocol  | Asset(s) | Blockchain(s) | Status | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [0x](https://www.0xproject.com/)  | ERC20 Tokens  | Ethereum | Live on mainnet | Generic exchange of ERC20 |
| [Dharma](https://dharma.io/) | ERC20 Tokens, Dharma Debt Token | Ethereum | Under development | Debt contracts |
| [Dydx](https://dydx.exchange/) | ERC20 Tokens, Dydx Derivatives (Option, Short Sell) | Ethereum | Under development | Derivatives contracts, uses 0x |
| [Lendroid](https://lendroid.com/) | ERC20 Tokens | Ethereum | Under development | Margin Loans |
| [OmiseGo](https://omisego.network/) | *All | *All | Under development | Both a blockchain and builtin support for decentralized exchange |
| [Set](https://setprotocol.com/) | ERC20 Tokens, Set Tokens | Ethereum | Under development | Token abstraction |
| [Snowglobe](https://auroradao.com/faq/) | ERC20 Tokens | Ethereum | Under development | Shared order book and liquidity |
| [Swap](https://swap.tech/faq/)  | ERC20 Tokens  | Ethereum | Under development | Closed protocol with plans to be open |
